# SirKit 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seckwei/SirKit_CircuitSim.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/seckwei/SirKit_CircuitSim)

SirKit (read as 'circuit'),  is my attempt to construct a JS circuit simulator that has HTML5 animations to illustrate various data and information of the circuit. This idea surfaced when I was shown [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKSgGamugTI), which ultimately led me to the [Paul Falstad's page](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/) that produced that animation. Soon after that, I found [EveryCircuit](http://everycircuit.com/)... and [DCAC Lab](http://dcaclab.com/)... and other online circuit sims.

Knowing that there are a handful of circuit sims (with animations), this project will still go on for a few reasons:

1. ~~None of the JS ones (or at least seems to be programmed with just JS) I've seen so far is open source.~~ Found really cool ones ([link to list](http://seckwei.github.io/SirKit_CircuitSim/doc/tutorial-problem-and-solution.html#others)), won't stop me from doing this anyway!
2. It's an interesting challenge to take on. Hopefully this will be educational to others as well.
3. [Why not?](http://i1.theportalwiki.net/img/a/a5/Cave_Johnson_fifties_fifth_test_complete09.wav)

## _Tell me more..._
Should you be interested in this ambitious journey, then you can check out the [Problem and Solution](http://seckwei.github.io/SirKit_CircuitSim/doc/tutorial-problem-and-solution.html) page of this project where I update my findings while undertaking this project. If for some reason you'd like to get in touch, do feel free to drop me an email - sirkit.js@gmail.com. :)

## _Can I play with this yet?_
Unfortunately, no. This is still in early stages of development. At the time of writing, I have only managed to get the program to tell if there's an open or close circuit, and not simulating anything yet. Visit again for more updates!

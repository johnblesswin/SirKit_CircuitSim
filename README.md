# SirKit

SirKit (read as 'circuit'),  is my attempt to construct a JS circuit simulator that has HTML5 animations to illustrate various data and information of the circuit. This idea surfaced when I was shown [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKSgGamugTI), which ultimately led me to the [Paul Falstad's page](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/) that produced that animation. Soon after that, I found [EveryCircuit](http://everycircuit.com/)... and [DCAC Lab](http://dcaclab.com/)... and other online circuit sims.

Knowing that there are a handful of circuit sims (with animations), this project will still go on for a few reasons:

1. ~~None of the JS ones (or at least seems to be programmed with just JS) I've seen so far is open source.~~ Found really cool ones (see Documentation.md), won't stop me from doing this anyway!
2. It's cool as heck.
3. [Why not?](http://i1.theportalwiki.net/img/a/a5/Cave_Johnson_fifties_fifth_test_complete09.wav)
